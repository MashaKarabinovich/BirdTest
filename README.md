# BirdTest

Hi there! 

--
This is a repository for a Bird Problem Test that I worked on. The focus is primary using c# and lists to answer a few questions. I am going to keep it brief for now for security reasons.

If you have made it here to evauluate, then you are probably wondering how to open it. 

You can either download the entire project and open it through Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code. 
Or download just the cs files to check if it works and use your own IDE or text editor to get it working. 
If you have any questions, don't be afraid to reach out! I am always willing to explain, help, or provide any other assistance. 

Thank you!
